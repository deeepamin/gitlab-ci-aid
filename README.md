## Change log

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what has changed recently.

## Known Issues
- Script injection is disabled for folded (>) blocks, as it is not handled well by Intellij YAML parser in Edit script fragment. 
  Use literal (|) blocks instead (Plugin provides intent action to convert folded block to literal block).
